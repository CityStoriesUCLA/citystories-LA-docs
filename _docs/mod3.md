#### Select your images
* You probably took more images than you need for your published article, so **choose the most appropriate images**.
* You must have at least 1 and up to 6 images for your article.
* You'll be able to crop and edit your images in the next steps.

#### Rename your image(s)
* Use **.jpg** images (definitely no PDFs, Word docs, etc.). If you have another file type (.png), these are easy to convert using the Export or Save as function in Preview (Mac) or Paint (Windows), respectively.
* Rename your image file(s) -- **something simple that reflects your article title**; no spaces, capitals, or other unnecessary characters; if you have multiple images, name them using the following convention: trumbo1.jpg, trumbo2.jpgâ€¦ You can view the naming format of the existing images here for reference: [https://github.com/CityStoriesUCLA/lyricalmap/tree/gh-pages/images.](https://github.com/CityStoriesUCLA/lyricalmap/tree/gh-pages/images.)

#### Edit your images
* If your images need it, **Crop** and **resize** each image to get it ready for publishing on the web
* There are a number of software options for this including Preview (Mac), Paint (Windows), Gimp (free alternative to Photoshop), and of course Adobe Photoshop.

#### Have images ready for class
* Bring images to class either through some sort of cloud based storage (Google Docs, Box) or a physical device (your laptop, USB flash drive, etc.)
