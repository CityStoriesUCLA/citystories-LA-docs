Markdown formatting is simple, yet powerful. You can find lots of guides online, but we recommend [this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Here are a few common formatting styles that should cover most needs:

##### Italics
In this project, you might italicize for two reasons: titles and foreign words. To italicize text, enclose the text to be italicized using a single asterisk on either side. Example: `*A Book Title*` will render as *A Book Title*.

##### Bold
To make text bold, enclose the text in double asterisks on either side. Example: `**this is bold**` will render as **this is bold**.

##### Sub-headings
You can also use header styles to give heading to sub-sections of your articles. For this project, we are using H4 for sub-headings. You can format an H4 using four hashtags: `#### Sub-heading 4`

##### Hyperlinks

In your bibliography, you may want to provide a link to the source if it is available online. To turn a section of text into a link, encode the title of the work as a link this formula:

`[Tenth Annual Catalogue of the State Normal School](http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/archive/catalog/1892-93catalog.pdf)`

this will render as [Tenth Annual Catalogue of the State Normal School](http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/archive/catalog/1892-93catalog.pdf).
