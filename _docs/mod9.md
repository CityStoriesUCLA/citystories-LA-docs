To submit your work thus far, you are going to do a **Pull request**. A pull request will send a message to the main repository letting us know that your fork is ready to merge into the main project page. To submit a pull request:

* From your `lyricalmap` repository (`[yourusername]/lyricalmap`), click on the "Pull requests" menu item.
* Now click on the big green "New pull request" button.
* First make sure your "base fork" is set to the `CityStoriesUCLA/lyricalmap` repo with the `master` branch selected.
* Then make sure your "head fork" is `[yourusername]/lyricalmap` repo with the `master` branch selected.
* If you want to, you can scroll down and see the changes you've made since forking the main project repository.
* When you are ready, click on the big green "Create pull request" button.

That's it! Once we receive your pull request, we'll look over your page. If everything looks good, we'll merge it into the main project page. If there are any issues, we'll let you know via the pull request so you can fix them.
