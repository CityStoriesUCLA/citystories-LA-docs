#### Create your article file
* **Only one person in your group will create the file!**
* In your GitHub `lyricalmap` repository `[githubusername] / lyricalmap`, navigate to the `_posts` directory.
* You are going to create a new file here by clicking the "Create New File" button [](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/create_new_file.png)
* The first thing we want to do is name our file - **The filename is very important!** 
    * Start the file name with today's date in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2018-02-12`
    * Next in the filename will be a dash `-` followed by the quarter, for example `w18` for Winter 2018
    * Next will be  an underscore, the word `section` and then your *section* number, for example `_section02` for section 2. If you do not know your section number, check the schedule of classes or ask your instructor
    * Next will be an underscore, followed by the word `group`, and then your group number, for example `_group01` for group 1
    * Finally, add the Markdown file extension `.md` -- you'll end up with something like: `2018-02-12-w18_section02_group01.md`
* Now that we've given our file a name, let's add some of the "Frontmatter", or the article's metadata. This "frontmatter" contains the essential information about your post. It must be formatted correctly for your post to display properly. Copy and paste the following into the text area of your file - make sure you get all the lines, including the three dashes on the first and last lines!:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kirschbombe/a806fe27ca6c9edb46c06c209b79d1f1.js"></script>

* While we're here, let's give the article a proper title. See where is says "enter your title here" next to the `title:` field? Let's replace this text (but leave the quotes) with the title of your article. You can always change this later if you decide, so don't worry if it's not perfect.
* Now that you've added your frontmatter and given your article a title, scroll down to bottom of the page, make sure "**Commit directly to the `master` branch**" option is selected, then click on the "**Commit changes**" button.

#### Previewing your article stub
* To view your article stub, visit the live project site for your repository.
* Once there, click on the menu icon on the top right of the map to expand and select "Article Index". Look for your article title in the list and click on it.
* There's not much there now, but you'll soon fill it in :)
