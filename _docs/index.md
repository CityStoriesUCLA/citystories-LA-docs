This guide contains the assignment modules for the "Los Angeles: The City and the Library" course project.

### Module Guide and Sample Syllabus

Here you will find modules containing step-by-step instructions for your project which need to be completed in order according to the deadlines listed on the syllabus.

To students: Do not wait until the last minute to do these modules because you will likely experience technical and editorial issues and will need time to edit, troubleshoot, and/or receive help. Check in with your instructor and librarians frequently for feedback and messages! You can contact the librarians through our Slack channel. Sign up for Slack at citystoriesucla.slack.com.
