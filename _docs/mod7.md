The project images are stored and hosted in our GitHub repository in the `images` folder. There are two methods for uploading your images to the GitHub repository:

First, navigate to the `images` folder and click on the "Upload files" button. ![](http://web.mst.edu/~mstiam/edit/upload-files.png)

Then, you can either

1. Drag and drop the images directly into the drop area, repeating for each additional image.
2. Click the "choose your files" option and select your files using the file explorer.

Once you’ve added all your images, scroll down to the bottom of the page, make sure “Commit directly to the master branch” is selected, then click on the green “Commit changes” button.

Navigate back to your `images` folder to verify that your new images are there and that you can view them.
