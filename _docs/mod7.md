The project images are stored and hosted in our GitHub repository in the `images` folder. There are two methods for uploading your images to the GitHub repository:

1. Drag and drop
  * Navigate to the `images` folder, then drag and drop the images directly onto the page. Repeate for each additional image.
  * Once you've added all your images, scroll down to the bottom of the page, make sure "Commit directly to the `gh-pages` branch" is selected, then click on the green "Commit changes" button.  

<br />--Or--<br />

2. "Upload files" button
    * From the `images` directory, you can select the "Upload Files" button, then continue as directed above.

Navigate back to your `images` folder to verify that your new images are there and that you can view them.
